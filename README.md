## âœ¨ What is the `garm-operator`?

`garm-operator` is a [KubernetesÂ®](https://kubernetes.io) operator that manages the lifecycle of [garm](https://github.com/cloudbase/garm) objects by creating/updating/deleting corresponding objects in the Kubernetes cluster.

## ðŸ”€ Versioning

### Garm Version

garm-operator uses [`garm-api-client`](https://github.com/cloudbase/garm/tree/main/client) to talk
with `garm` servers. The supported `garm` server version is determined by `garm-api-client`.

### Kubernetes Version

garm-operator uses [`client-go`](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go) to talk with
Kubernetes clusters. The supported Kubernetes cluster version is determined by `client-go`.
The compatibility matrix for client-go and Kubernetes cluster can be found
[here](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go#compatibility-matrix).

## ðŸš€ Installation

### Prerequisites

1. A Kubernetes cluster you want to deploy the `garm-operator`.
1. As we use `ValidatingWebhooks` for validation, `cert-manager` must be installed. (You can find the installation instructions [here](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/)).
1. You need to have a `garm` server up and running and reachable from within the Kubernetes cluster you want to deploy the `garm-operator`.

### Deployment

#### `garm-operator`

We are releasing the `garm-operator` as container image together with the corresponding Kubernetes manifests. You can find the latest release [here](https://github.com/mercedes-benz/garm-operator/releases).

This manifests can be used to deploy the `garm-operator` into your Kubernetes cluster.

```bash
export GARM_OPERATOR_VERSION=<garm-operator-version>
export GARM_SERVER_URL=<garm-server-url> 
export GARM_SERVER_USERNAME=<garm-server-username>
export GARM_SERVER_PASSWORD=<garm-server-password>
export OPERATOR_WATCH_NAMESPACE=<operator-watch-namespace>
curl -L https://github.com/mercedes-benz/garm-operator/releases/download/${GARM_OPERATOR_VERSION}/garm-operator-all.yaml | envsubst | kubectl apply -f -
```

The full configuration parsing documentation can be found in the [configuration parsing guide](./docs/config/configuration-parsing.md)

#### Custom Resources

The CRD documentation can be also seen via [docs.crds.dev](https://doc.crds.dev/github.com/mercedes-benz/garm-operator).

Folder `config/samples` contains few basic examples of `Pools`, `Images` and corresponding `Repositories`, `Organizations` or `Enterprises`.
